### Learning Points & Summary
In this lesson we looked at how to:

- Use nested loops to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns

- Filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both `.loc[]` and `.query()`

- Create bubble charts using the Seaborn Library

- Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters

- Use floor division (i.e., integer division) to convert years to decades

- Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regressions over our data

- Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well the model fits our data and the r-squared metric

- Run regressions with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficients.
