### Learning Points & Summary
In this lesson we looked at how to:

- Create arrays manually with `np.array()`

- Generate arrays using  `.arange()`, `.random()`, and `.linspace()`

- Analyse the shape and dimensions of a ndarray

- Slice and subset a ndarray based on its indices

- Do linear algebra like operations with scalars and matrix multiplication

- Use NumPys broadcasting to make ndarray shapes compatible

- Manipulate images in the form of ndarrays
