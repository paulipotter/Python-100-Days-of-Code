### Learning Points & Summary
In this lesson we looked at how to:

- use HTML Markdown in Notebooks, such as section headings # and how to embed images with the `<img>` tag.
- combine the `groupby()` and `count()` functions to aggregate data
- use the `.value_counts()` function
- slice DataFrames using the square bracket notation e.g., `df[:-2]` or `df[:10]`
- use the `.agg()` function to run an operation on a particular column
- `rename()` columns of DataFrames
- create a line chart with two separate axes to visualise data that have different scales.
- create a scatter plot in Matplotlib
- work with tables in a relational database by using primary and foreign keys
- `.merge()` DataFrames along a particular column
- create a bar chart with Matplotlib
